# bimorph_adaptive_plan

In progress Neural Network Bimorph Mirror optimisation

This is where you should write a short paragraph that describes what your module does,
how it does it, and why people should use it.

Source          | <https://github.com/DiamondRC/bimorph-adaptive-plan>
:---:           | :---:
PyPI            | `pip install bimorph-adaptive-plan`
Releases        | <https://github.com/DiamondRC/bimorph-adaptive-plan/releases>

This is where you should put some images or code snippets that illustrate
some relevant examples. If it is a library then you might put some
introductory code here:

```python
from bimorph_adaptive_plan import __version__

print(f"Hello bimorph_adaptive_plan {__version__}")
```

Or if it is a commandline tool then you might put some example commands here:

```
python -m bimorph_adaptive_plan --version
```
